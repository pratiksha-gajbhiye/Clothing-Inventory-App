The **Clothing Inventory App** is a comprehensive inventory and billing management system tailored for clothing shops and garment businesses. Built using Java Spring Boot, this application allows users to manage products, handle stock in and out, create sales and purchase bills, and generate insightful reports. It supports real-time billing (POS), customer and supplier tracking, and provides a powerful dashboard to monitor daily operations, low stock alerts, and financial summaries â€” all from a single unified platform.
